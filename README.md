SOLID Principles
================
A reminder for myself when I'm forgetting one of these principles. Code examples are taken from [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com).

- [Single responsibility](1-single-responsibility.md)
- [Open closed](2-open-closed.md)
- [Liskov Subsitution](3-liskov-substitution.md)
- [Interface Segregation](4-interface-segregation.md)
- [Dependency Inversion](5-dependency-inversion.md)
